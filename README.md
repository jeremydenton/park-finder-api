This app allows users to create a park in the database that can be viewed by other users. Parks contain names, addresses, and whether or not they have a bathroom. Users can edit and delete those parks that they created.

Technologies:
SCSS
HTML
Javascript
Rails and therefore Ruby
Handlebars
JQuery


In future iterations the app will have a more coherent style. It will also have a join table which will allow users to “check-in” at parks.

The initial plan for the project was much more expansive. Thanks to the council of the SEI consultants the scope of the project was substantially reduced. Problems were generally solved with a three step approach.
Check for syntax errors.
Look up the issue on the world wide web.
Make an issue in the issue cue.
This approach was much more effective than the previously applied “try to figure it out on your own” approach.
